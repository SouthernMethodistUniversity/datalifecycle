# Data Life Cycle 

## Overview
* This is part of the [Summer Research Intensive program (2021) series.](https://www.smu.edu/Provost/Engaged-Learning/Research/URA/Summer-Research-Intensive) 
* This session is 90 minutes, there will be time for questions at the end. 
* Discussion of: using data, forms and types of data, big data, your data project and additional resources.

 # Introduction to the stages of the Data Life Cycle 
* When we talk about data, what do we mean? 
* What is the data life cycle? Where are you on this cycle? Which steps apply to you? 
* We are discussing these steps as a list, which may make you think of them as sequential, however: you may skip some steps, you may go back and forth between various steps - it all depends on what you are trying to do and what your role in your current research project is.

* Research questions
  - Why are you looking for data? What kind of data do you think will have useful information for your questions?

* Data Search/ Reuse 
  - You are looking for already existing data/data sets that you can reuse for your research.
  - [Search Strategies](https://guides.smu.edu/searchstrategies)
  - [Data Sources @ SMU Libraries](https://guides.smu.edu/data)
  - Is the data you found in the proper format for analysis? Is is clean and structured? 

* Data Management Plan (DMP)
   - Do you need a long term plan to manage your data? 
   - Do you want to share it with others? 
   - Does the grant you are working on require you have a plan for sharing and/or preserving your data? 
   - [Research Data Management Support @ SMU](https://www.smu.edu/libraries/fondren/services/data)

 * Data Storage (Collection, Description, Recollection) 
    - Where are you going to store the data? 
    - Do you want to store the description/metadata?

  * Analysis
    - You are deciding what tools (Excel) or Scripts (Python, R) ask some questions of your data)

  * Archive
    - You are done using the data, but you want to save it for the long term.

  * Publications
    - You are now publishing your results, research and/or the data set.
    - Data visualizations are a type of publication.
