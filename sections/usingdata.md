# Using Data 

# What is data? 

## What kind of data are you using?
* Big (Kaplan, 2015)
* Small (Klienmann, 2016)
* Micro (Risam & Edwards, 2017)
* Smart (Schöch, 2013)
* Ambiguous
* Gender & race (Posner, 2015; McPherson, 2012)
* Historical geographic information (Plewe 2002)
* **"the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed." [Drucker](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html)**

## When we discuss using data in research, what questions do we need to ask about our data sets?
* Do those sets even exist? 
* Are they openly accessible? 
* What restrictions might we encounter? 
    * Copyright
    * Licensing
    * Format
    * Cleanliness
* What ethical considerations might ensue? Institutional Review Boards (IRB) are meant to provide oversight for research studies (involving human subjects). Are IRBs sufficient, or are there additional considerations?
    * [SMU Research Compliance](https://www.smu.edu/Research/ResearchServices/ResearchCompliance)
* What does it mean to use data collected for one purpose for a different purpose? What is left out? 
    * [What does platform data tell us?](https://points.datasociety.net/how-not-to-know-ourselves-5227c185569 )
    * What research questions can you ask? 
    * Big Data, Medium Data, Small Data, Curated data, Clean data
