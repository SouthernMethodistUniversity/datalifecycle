# Using Data 

## [What are the differences between data, a dataset, and a database?](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-are-differences-between-data-a-dataset-and-a-database?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products)
  - "Data are observations or measurements (unprocessed or processed) represented as text, numbers, or multimedia.
  - A dataset is a structured collection of data generally associated with a unique body of work.
  - A database is an organized collection of data stored as multiple datasets. Those datasets are generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system that allows the data to be easily accessed, manipulated, and updated." 


## What kind of data are you using?]
* Big (Kaplan, 2015)
* Small (Klienmann, 2016)
* Micro (Risam & Edwards, 2017)
* Smart (Schöch, 2013)
* Ambiguous
* Gender & race (Posner, 2015; McPherson, 2012)
* Historical geographic information (Plewe 2002)
* **"the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed." [Drucker](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html)**

## When we discuss using data in research, what questions do we need to ask about our data sets?
* Do those sets even exist? 
* Are they openly accessible? 
* What restrictions might we encounter? 
    * Copyright
    * Licensing
    * Format
    * Cleanliness
* What ethical considerations might ensue? Institutional Review Boards (IRB) are meant to provide oversight for research studies (involving human subjects). Are IRBs sufficient, or are there additional considerations?
    * [SMU Research Compliance](https://www.smu.edu/Research/ResearchServices/ResearchCompliance)
* What does it mean to use data collected for one purpose for a different purpose? What is left out? 
    * [What does platform data tell us?](https://points.datasociety.net/how-not-to-know-ourselves-5227c185569 )
    * What research questions can you ask? 
    * Big Data, Medium Data, Small Data, Curated data, Clean data
* What does the metadata or description tell you about the data? 
    * [Data Dictionaries: A data dictionary is used to catalog and communicate the structure and content of data, and provides meaningful descriptions for individually named data objects.](https://www.usgs.gov/products/data-and-tools/data-management/data-dictionaries)
