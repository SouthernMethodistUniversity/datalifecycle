# Forms of Data

There are many ways to represent data, just as there are many sources of data. After processing our data, we turn it into a number of products. For example:

* Non-digital text (lab books, field notebooks)

* Digital texts or digital copies of text

* Spreadsheets

* Audio

* Video

* Computer Aided Design/CAD

* Statistical analysis (SPSS, SAS)

* Databases

* Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial data

* Digital copies of images

* Web files

* Scientific sample collections

* Matlab files & 3D Models

* Metadata & Paradata

* Data visualizations

* Computer code

* Standard operating procedures and protocols

* Protein or genetic sequences

* Artistic products

* Curriculum materials

* Collection of digital objects acquired and generated during research

## Discussion: Forms of Data
These are some (most!) of the shapes your research data might transform into. What are some forms of data you use in your work? What about forms of data that you produce as your output? Perhaps there are some forms that are typical of your field? Where do you usually get your data from?


# Stages of Data

We begin without data. Then it is observed, or made, or imagined, or generated. After that, it goes through further transformations:

## Raw
    
Raw data is yet to be processed, meaning it has yet to be manipulated by a human or computer. Received or collected data could be in any number of formats, locations, etc.. It could be in any of the forms listed above.

But "raw data" is a relative term, inasmuch as when one person finishes processing data and presents it as a finished product, another person may take that product and work on it further, and for them that data is "raw data". 

### Discussion: Raw Data
For example, is "big data" "raw data"? How do we understand data that we have "scraped"?

## Processed/Transformed

Processing data puts it into a state more readily available for analysis, and makes the data legible. For instance it could be rendered as **structured data**. This can also take many forms, e.g., a table. 

Here are a few you're likely to come across, all representing the same data:

### XML

```
<Cats> 
    <Cat> 
        <firstName>Smally</firstName> <lastName>McTiny</lastName> 
    </Cat> 
    <Cat> 
        <firstName>Kitty</firstName> <lastName>Kitty</lastName> 
    </Cat> 
    <Cat> 
        <firstName>Foots</firstName> <lastName>Smith</lastName> 
    </Cat> 
    <Cat> 
        <firstName>Tiger</firstName> <lastName>Jaws</lastName> 
    </Cat> 
</Cats> 
```

### JSON

```
{"Cats":[ 
    { "firstName":"Smally", "lastName":"McTiny" }, 
    { "firstName":"Kitty", "lastName":"Kitty" }, 
    { "firstName":"Foots", "lastName":"Smith" }, 
    { "firstName":"Tiger", "lastName":"Jaws" } 
]} 
```

### CSV
```
First Name,Last Name/n
Smally,McTiny/n
Kitty,Kitty/n
Foots,Smith/n
Tiger,Jaws/n
```

#### The importance of using open data formats
A small detour to discuss (the ethics of?) data formats. For accessibility, future-proofing, and preservation, keep your data in open, sustainable formats. A demonstration:

1. Open [this file](cats.csv) in a text editor, and then in an app like Excel. This is a CSV, an open, text-only, file format.
2. Now do the same with [this one](cats.xlsx). This is a proprietary format! 

Sustainable formats are generally unencrypted, uncompressed, and follow an open standard. A small list:

* ASCII

* PDF 

* .csv

* FLAC

* TIFF

* JPEG2000

* MPEG-4

* XML

* RDF

* .txt

* .r

### Discussion: Processed/Transformed
How do you decide the formats to store your data when you transition from 'raw' to 'processed/transformed' data? What are some of your considerations?

## Tidy Data
There are guidelines to the processing of data, sometimes referred to as **Tidy Data**.<sup>1</sup> One manifestation of these rules:
1. Each variable is in a column.
2. Each observation is a row.
3. Each value is a cell.



Look back at our example of cats to see how they may or may not follow those guidelines. **Important note**: some data formats allow for more than one dimension of data! How might that complicate the concept of **Tidy Data**?

```
{"Cats":[
    {"Calico":[
    { "firstName":"Smally", "lastName":"McTiny" },
    { "firstName":"Kitty", "lastName":"Kitty" }],
    "Tortoiseshell":[
    { "firstName":"Foots", "lastName":"Smith" }, 
    { "firstName":"Tiger", "lastName":"Jaws" }]}]}
```
